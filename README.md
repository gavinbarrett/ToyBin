## ToyBin
ToyBin is a simple Bash script I use to keep my home directory nice and clean. If you're anything like me, you're very prone to opening up plenty of new files for prototyping code snippets or taking notes.

## Downloading / Installing
To download, simply clone the repo:
```bash
# download the script from this repository
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gavinbarrett/ToyBin/master/toybin
# mv the script into your
mv toybin .local/bin
```

Now, running <code>~$ toybin</code> will take any loose file from the home directory and sort it into a directory under ~/.toybin/
